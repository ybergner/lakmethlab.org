			<h4> Organizers </h4>


			<strong> Yoav Bergner </strong> is an Assistant Professor of Learning Sciences and Educational Technology at NYU Steinhardt. He earned an A.B. in physics from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Yoav's research bridges psychometrics and learning sciences in pursuit of analysis methods that inform educational design. He is particularly interested in the assessment of learning in Makerspaces/Fablabs, social learning in online environments, physics education, and collaborative problem solving.

		<strong> 	Geraldine Gray </strong> is a Senior Lecturer in Informatics at TU Dublin (Blanchardstown campus). She has been actively engaged in learning analytics research for a number of years and is currently focusing on addressing perceived barriers to campus-wide engagement with learning data. Geraldine has worked in Blanchardstown since it opened in 1999, initially developing ITS programmes, and more recently specializing in data science. She runs their MSc programme in Applied Data Science and Analytics and supervises a number of data science research students.
